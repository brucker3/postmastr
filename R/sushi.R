#' Sushi Resturants in the St. Louis Region
#'
#' @description A selection of sushi resturants in the St. Louis, Missouri region.
#'    These data are in long form, with multiple visits in a single year to some
#'    of the resturants. They also contain a degree of messiness, with a mix of
#'    upper and lower case tying, some street types abbreviated (i.e. "St") and
#'    others entered in full (i.e. "Street"), and an example of two ways in which
#'    unit numbers may appear. State names are given both in full and using the
#'    standard two-letter abbreviation, and city names as well as postal codes
#'    are included. Postal codes are given in both the standard five digit
#'    form as well as the elongated "zip+4" format.
